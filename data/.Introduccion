A DNA Individual Motif (IM) is a short pattern conserved between species
that can be bind by proteins like Transcription Factors (TFs) enabling gene
regulation. They specifically recognize a nucleotide IM sequence called
Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) either in gene promoter or
terminator regions. Searching of TFBSs is an empirical discipline of
genomics which is a key step prior to TFBS functional validation either by
gel shift assays (EMSA) or by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Both
techniques allow the examination of the interaction between a TF and DNA
sequence (Jayaram, Usvyat and R. Martin 2016).
